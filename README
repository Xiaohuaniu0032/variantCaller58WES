Torrent Variant Caller (TVC) is a genetic variant caller for Ion Torrentâ„¢ Sequencing platforms, and is specially optimized to exploit the underlying flow signal information in the statistical model to evaluate variants. Torrent Variant Caller is designed to call single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), insertions, deletions, and block substitutions.
